We will be using the K&R C++ style convention
It is a good balance between compactness and readability

basically...
for classes, namespaces, functions, exc. we start the '{' on a new line, whereas we do not for things within those containers (if, for, case-switch, while, exc.)



for example:

{{{
class Vector
{
    public:
        Vector();
        int x, y;
}

Vector::Vector()
{
    if (true) {
        x = 1;
        y = 1;
    } else {
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
    }
}
}}}


also, we put a space before a '(', only when it is a built-in operation (such as if or while), but not a function call.  We also always use '{...}', even when it isn't necessary (to reduce errors)

for example:
{{{
customFunction(x, y);

if (x > y) {
    while (true) { // '{' isn't required, but we do it anyway
        doSomething();
    }
}
}}}
